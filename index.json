[{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been a FreeBSD user since the late 90s. From 2002 to 2010, I was a ports committer working on the GNOME and Multimedia teams. I have always felt more \u0026ldquo;at home\u0026rdquo; with FreeBSD. There is a logic and cohesiveness to the Base System + Ports approach that just clicks for me in a way Linux distros often don\u0026rsquo;t.\nBut the world changed. The OCI (Docker) container workflow took over, and for good reason: immutable infrastructure and easy updates are incredible for sanity.\nFor a long time, I was stuck in a dilemma:\nRun Linux: Get the great container workflow, but lose the OS I love (ZFS, Jails, consistency). Run FreeBSD: Keep the OS, but go back to \u0026ldquo;sysadmin drudgery\u0026rdquo;—manually maintaining dependencies inside 15 different Jails like it\u0026rsquo;s 2005. Run a Linux VM on FreeBSD: The worst of both worlds. Overhead + complexity. The Solution With podman and ocijail stabilizing on FreeBSD, I realized we could finally bridge this gap.\nI built Daemonless to provide a polished, \u0026ldquo;Docker-like\u0026rdquo; experience that runs natively on FreeBSD.\nNo Linux VM. Native Performance. Real FreeBSD Jails under the hood. It isn\u0026rsquo;t just a tech demo; it\u0026rsquo;s a full fleet of high-quality images (Radarr, Sonarr, Traefik, etc.) built with s6-overlay for supervision and proper user mapping (PUID/PGID).\nMy goal is simple: Make \u0026ldquo;Docker on FreeBSD\u0026rdquo; as boring and reliable as it is on Linux.\nCheck out the project at daemonless.io or browse the images.\n","permalink":"https://ahze.net/posts/why-i-built-daemonless/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been a FreeBSD user since the late 90s.
