I have owned **ahze.net** for a very long time.

For most of that time, this domain has been a quiet corner of the internet—mostly used for internal lab services, mail, or just sitting idle. I've rarely had anything public-facing or inviting for the outside world to see.

**I'm changing that today.**

I've decided to start documenting my projects, my experiments with FreeBSD, and the growth of the **Daemonless** ecosystem here. This site is currently running inside a Daemonless Hugo container on my own infrastructure, which feels like the right way to kick things off.

It's time to put some of this "shit" I've been building out where people can actually use it.

Stay tuned.
