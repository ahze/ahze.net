## Who I Am

I am a **Technical Program Manager** and long-time **FreeBSD enthusiast** with a deep background in systems engineering.

My career has spanned decades in infrastructure, from being a **FreeBSD Ports Committer** (2002-2010, focusing on GNOME and Multimedia) to managing complex technical programs in modern environments.

## The Mission

I believe in **simplicity and reliability**. This philosophy drives my work on **[Daemonless](https://daemonless.io)**, where I aim to bridge the gap between the rock-solid stability of FreeBSD Jails and the modern convenience of OCI (Docker) container workflows.
